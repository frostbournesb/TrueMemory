## 🔬 Benchmark

Tested on [LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo), the standard benchmark for conversational memory. 1,540 questions across 10 conversations. All 8 systems share the same answer model, judge, scoring, top-k, and byte-identical answer prompt — only retrieval differs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/charts/leaderboard-bar.png" alt="LoCoMo 8-System Comparison" />
</p>

TrueMemory achieves **state-of-the-art accuracy for fully-local memory systems** at zero ongoing infrastructure cost. Base runs entirely offline with no API keys. Pro adds one small LLM call per query for HyDE query expansion.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/charts/accuracy-vs-cost.png" alt="Accuracy vs Infrastructure Cost" />
</p>

All scores use the same evaluation pipeline: GPT-4.1-mini answer generation, GPT-4o-mini judge (3x majority vote), temperature=0. Zero errors across 12,320 total answers. Scores use a lenient semantic-match judge; rankings are valid across all systems but absolute values are higher than published LoCoMo baselines using strict exact-match.

## ⚡ Research Highlights

- **30+ percentage points more accurate than Mem0** on LoCoMo (91.5% vs 61.4%)
- **2x more cost-efficient** per correct answer than Mem0
- **Runs offline** on any device with Python 3.10+ and 512MB RAM
- **One SQLite file, zero API keys.** The entire 6-layer system runs offline.
- **Within 3.0pp of EverMemOS**, the only higher-scoring system — and EverMemOS uses pre-computed retrieval rather than live search at query time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/charts/category-radar.png" alt="Category Breakdown" />
</p>

TrueMemory Pro nearly matches EverMemOS across all 4 question categories. Mem0 collapses on multi-hop reasoning (37.7% vs 90.7%).

## 🏗️ Base vs Pro

Same features, same 6-layer pipeline. **Pro upgrades the embedding model and the cross-encoder reranker** for higher retrieval accuracy.

| | Base | Pro |
|---|------|-----|
| **LoCoMo** | 88.2% | 91.5% |
| **Runs on** | Any machine (CPU only) | 4GB+ RAM (CPU or GPU) |
| **First install** | ~30MB | ~1.5GB one-time download |
| **Speed** | Ultra-fast | Fast |

**Base** works everywhere. **Pro** remembers better.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

One command. Works on any Mac or Linux box, **even if your system Python is old or missing entirely.**

**Step 1.** Open Terminal:
- **Mac:** press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press `Enter`
- **Linux:** press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (or open your distro's terminal app)

**Step 2.** Paste this one line and press `Enter`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Step 3.** Wait ~1-2 minutes while it downloads and installs. You'll see progress messages scroll by — that's normal.

**Step 4.** If Claude Desktop was already open, **quit it with `Cmd+Q` and reopen it** (a new chat window is not enough — the config is only read at launch). Then start a new Claude session and TrueMemory walks you through choosing **Base** or **Pro** on first run.

> **What this actually does:** installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Astral's Python tool manager) if needed, fetches a managed Python 3.12 into `~/.local/share/uv/`, installs TrueMemory into an isolated tool environment, and auto-configures Claude Code and Claude Desktop. **Your system Python is never touched.** No sudo, no venvs, no pip struggle. Uninstall cleanly with `uv tool uninstall truememory`.

> **Want to audit the script first?** It's ~140 lines of shell, no sudo, stays entirely under `$HOME`. Read the source at [`install.sh`](install.sh), or download and inspect locally: `curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh -o install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh`.

> **Want Pro (adds GPU reranker + sentence-transformers, ~1.5-2.5GB depending on OS)?**
> ```bash
> curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildingjoshbetter/TrueMemory/main/install.sh | TRUEMEMORY_EXTRAS="gpu,mcp" sh
> ```
> The default install is **Base** (~30MB). If you pick Pro during first-run setup, TrueMemory will prompt you to install the extra models.
> *(Linux CPU-only boxes will pull PyTorch's default CUDA wheel, which is larger — ~2.5GB total. Mac installs are closer to ~1.5GB.)*

### Python library (for developers)

If you're embedding TrueMemory in your own Python project (requires Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install truememory
```

```python
from truememory import Memory

m = Memory()
m.add("Prefers dark mode and TypeScript", user_id="alex")
m.add("Allergic to peanuts", user_id="alex")

results = m.search("What are Alex's preferences?", user_id="alex")
print(results[0]["content"])
# → "Prefers dark mode and TypeScript"
```

The database is created automatically at `~/.truememory/memories.db`.

## 🤖 What happens on first run?

Claude forgets you between sessions. TrueMemory fixes that.

On your first session after installing, TrueMemory will:

1. **Welcome you** and show your current version
2. **Ask Base or Pro** — you choose your accuracy tier
3. **Optionally accept an API key** — for enhanced search via HyDE query expansion (Anthropic, OpenRouter, or OpenAI)
4. **Show you how it works** — with example prompts to try

After setup, TrueMemory runs automatically. It stores what you tell it and recalls it in future sessions — no manual work needed.

### Make it automatic (optional)

Copy [`CLAUDE.md.example`](CLAUDE.md.example) to your home directory as `CLAUDE.md`. This tells Claude to store your preferences and recall them without being asked:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md.example ~/CLAUDE.md
```

### Manual setup

If auto-setup doesn't detect your Claude installation, you can configure manually.

**Claude Code** (if you used the installer above):
```bash
claude mcp add truememory -- truememory-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop:** add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings > Developer > Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truememory": {
      "command": "/Users/YOU/.local/bin/truememory-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> Use the **absolute path** to `truememory-mcp` — run `which truememory-mcp` to find it. Claude Desktop (and most non-Claude-Code MCP clients) don't inherit your shell's PATH, so relative commands will silently fail.

**No-install alternative (uvx):** skip installing TrueMemory entirely and let Claude run it ephemerally. Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to be installed.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truememory": {
      "command": "/Users/YOU/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.12", "--from", "truememory[mcp]", "truememory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

uvx creates a cached environment on first run; subsequent spawns are fast. Good if you want TrueMemory to always be latest-on-PyPI without managing an install.
